# Predictive-Analysis-of-Sales-Trends

Predictive Analysis of Sales Trends is a data-driven approach that leverages historical sales data and statistical modeling techniques to make informed predictions about future sales performance.
Predictive Analysis of Sales Trends is a data-driven approach used by businesses and organizations to gain deeper insights into their sales data and make informed predictions about future sales performance. This in-depth analysis involves a combination of statistical techniques, data mining, and machine learning algorithms to extract valuable information from historical sales data and use it to forecast future trends and outcomes.
The Analysis process involves as following;

**1.Data Collection and Gathering.**

The process begins with the collection and aggregation of historical sales data.

**2.Data Preprocessing.**

Before analysis can begin, the collected data needs to be preprocessed. This includes tasks such as cleaning the data to handle missing values and outliers, transforming data into a suitable format, and normalizing or scaling numerical variables.

**3.Feature Engineering.**

Feature engineering involves creating new variables or features based on the existing data.

**4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).**

EDA is an essential step to gain a better understanding of the data.This step often includes the creation of charts, histograms, scatter plots, and time series plots.

**5.Model Selection.**

Selecting the appropriate predictive model is a critical decision. Common models used in sales trend analysis include linear regression, time series models.
The choice of model depends on the characteristics of the data and the specific problem.

**6.Model Evaluation.**

The performance of the predictive model is assessed using various evaluation metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error...etc,.
